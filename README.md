# blogz
 Built project using Python3, Flask, and Jinja2 for the routing, templates, and controllers.  
 The project included persist data in a MySQL database, retrieving the data for display (FlaskSQLalchemy),added authentication for login to create posts, and limiting access to visitors without accounts. For database security, I added password hashing and salting. 
 This project was an addition to Build-a-Blog project. Refactoring to expand my codebase making this a multi-user blog site.  
 This project features different user scenarios. Required login, verification, CRUD database, and log out.  Logged-in users, can create new posts, sort, delete, and modify. Not logged-in users are directed to login page and can also view a display of default sort.
